# 

I am a quantitative ecologist interested in how and why biodiversity patterns change across time and space. I use a range of approaches -- from field experiments to computer simulations -- to understand how species interactions and demography respond to environmental variation across scales. 

I am currently a Ph.D. student at [Jonathan Levine](http://www.plantecology.ethz.ch/)'s group in ETH Zurich, where I am investigating how species interactions across heterogeneous landscapes mediate ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change.
