Locally adapted populations may differ in their responses to climate change when the traits selected by their new environment are correlated with those selected by the historical competitive environment."

Adaptation to competitors can promote or difficult persistence in novel environments depending on the alignment between selective pressures imposed by competitors and by the changing environment. The fine scale mosaic of selective pressures created by contrasting competitive neighbourhoods can cause patterns of local adaptation that increase the resilience of metapopulations facing climate change.
