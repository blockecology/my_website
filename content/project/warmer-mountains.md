# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "Many of the most dramatic biological impacts of climate change are mediated by species interactions. Still, we largely ignore how climate change influences the way species interact, and how this affects community dynamics. Due to their steep climatic and ecologic gradients, mountains are excellent systems to study how species interactions will influence community dynamics in future climates. By transplanting intact alpine communities to lower elevations in the Swiss Alps we are investigating how species interactions depend on temperature and how novel competitors from lower elevations will impact the community."

Novel competitors can shape plant community responses to climate change, but the timescales of their effects are poorly understood. During my PhD, I will integrate field experiments with mechanistic models to explore the relative timescales of community dynamics driven by novel competitors and by changing interactions among current competitors. I will also explore the usefulness of functional traits as predictors of species responses to changing climates and competitive environments.
