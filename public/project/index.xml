      <title>Competitor Adaptation and Climate Change Responses</title>

      <description>Adaptation to competitors can promote or difficult persistence in novel environments depending on the alignment between selective pressures imposed by competitors and by the changing environment. The fine scale mosaic of selective pressures created by contrasting competitive neighbourhoods can cause patterns of local adaptation that increase the resilience of metapopulations facing climate change.</description>

      <title>Species Interactions in Warmer Alps</title>

      <description>Many of the most dramatic biological impacts of climate change are mediated by species interactions. Still, we largely ignore how climate change influences the way species interact, and how this affects community dynamics. Due to their steep climatic and ecologic gradients, mountains are excellent systems to study how species interactions will influence community dynamics in future climates.
For the main component of my doctoral research, in collaboration with Loï¿½c Pellisier, and Jake Alexander, we transplanted alpine communities to lower elevations in the Swiss Alps to investigate how species interactions depend on temperature and how novel competitors from lower elevations will impact alpine vegetation.</description>
