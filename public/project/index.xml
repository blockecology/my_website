      <title>Competitor Adaptation and Climate Change Responses</title>

      <description>Adaptation to competitors can promote or difficult persistence in novel environments depending on the alignment between selective pressures imposed by competitors and by the changing environment. The fine scale mosaic of selective pressures created by contrasting competitive neighbourhoods can cause patterns of local adaptation that increase the resilience of metapopulations facing climate change.</description>

      <title>Oak forest diversity in an heterogeneous volcanic landscape</title>

      <description>For the last 20 million years, volcanic activity in south-central Mexico has created a geological mosaic that shapes the patterns of structure and diversity of the vegetation across the region. In El Tepozteco National Park, just a few miles south of Mexico City, oak forests cover a complex geomorphological landscape composed of eroded lahars and lava flows of different ages and degrees of soil development.
For my Bachelor research thesis, I described the patterns of oak forest diversity and structure across this geomorphological mosaic, analysed its relation to landscape-scale environmental heterogeneity, and studied the potential of analysing Google Earth satellite image attributes to model and predict vegetation properties.</description>

      <title>Species Interactions in Warmer Alps</title>

      <description>Many of the most dramatic biological impacts of climate change are mediated by species interactions. Still, we largely ignore how climate change influences the way species interact, and how this affects community dynamics. Due to their steep climatic and ecologic gradients, mountains are excellent systems to study how species interactions will influence community dynamics in future climates.
For the main component of my doctoral research, in collaboration with Loï¿½c Pellisier, and Jake Alexander, we transplanted alpine communities to lower elevations in the Swiss Alps to investigate how species interactions depend on temperature and how novel competitors from lower elevations will impact alpine vegetation.</description>
